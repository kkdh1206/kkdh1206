# Hi, I'm DoHyung, Kim

I'm an undergraduate student in Computer Science at POSTECH, interested in discrete algorithms, geometry, and new technologies.

I like problems where structure matters — especially graph and matching problems — and I enjoy figuring out why something works, not just making it work.

## Research

**Matching in General Disk Graphs**

I’m currently studying matching in general disk graphs.

The main idea is to use geometric properties of disk intersection graphs to improve time complexity, instead of relying only on classical combinatorial approaches.

(Paper in preparation.)
